							<h1>Fosters First</h1>
							<!--<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
							<strong>The Challenge</strong>
							<p>With approximately 6.5 million companion animals entering U.S. animal shelters each year there are not enough facilities to house them all.
							<BLOCKQUOTE>Brick and mortar animal shelters in the US: 3,000
							</br>Rescue groups and animal sanctuaries in North America: 10,000
							</br>Dogs and cats euthanized each day: 2,000</BLOCKQUOTE>
							Fosters are volunteers who help animals by providing them with a place until they find their forever home. These volunteers help these animals decompress from stressful shelter environments, heal from illnesses/injuries, work on behavior training, and prepare them for home life and successful adoption. Yet these essential volunteers may not always feel supported.</p>
							<!--<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
							<strong>Discovery</strong>
							<p>Our team spent weeks learning about the animal adoption process and the nuanced details in fostering animals. We surveyed organizations and adopters and spoke with rescue directors and foster volunteers. We also analyzed a few shelter management apps and systems to learn more about how organizations and fosters communicate and document animal milestones.</p>
							<BLOCKQUOTE><DL>
							<DT>Research Questions</DT>
							<DD>How can we better support the experience for foster pet parents and encourage more people to foster animals?</DD></DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
							<strong>Diary Study</strong>
							<p>After the surveys and interviews, we understood the overall fostering process better but failed to capture the full experience of a foster, which led us to conduct a diary study. For fourteen consecutive days, participants submitted their daily entries using Google sheets/forms, in addition to uploading photos/videos of their experience to their personal Google Drive.  With the diary study, we were able to understand the daily challenges, achievements, and milestones of the foster pet, however, we found minimal data around the organization’s direct involvement in this process.</p>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>
								<strong>Key Insights</strong>
							<OL>
							<LI>Having a sense of community is essential to a foster.
							<LI>The history of an animal is often unknown so any behavior or health issues are managed by the foster’s instincts or by the organization’s knowledge.
							<LI>There are feelings of uncertainty regarding the decompression period of an animal, but milestones are always documented.
							<LI>Fostering an animal provides fosters with a sense of fulfillment but is emotionally difficult when adoption occurs.
							</OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
							<strong>Co-Design Session</strong>
							<p>To further understand and identify pain points in the animal fostering experience, we conducted a two-hour co-design session to connect with our users. During the co-design workshop, we had participants write love and break up letters to the organization they foster with this activity provided us with raw emotions/feelings that we were able to translate into primary pain points with the users. With the major pain points in mind, we played a round of crazy eights to ideate possible solutions.</p>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>
								<strong>Key Insights</strong>
							<OL>
							<LI>The communication between the foster and organization is a point of friction, especially around medical appointments, animal behavior, and adoptions.
							<LI>The infrastructure of the organizations is not set up to properly support fosters because they are growing too quickly and risk burn out.
							<LI>Community is a primary reason volunteers continue to work with an organization.
							</OL></BLOCKQUOTE>

							<strong>Synthesis and Overall Insights</strong>
							</br>Based on the insights we gathered from our diary study and co-design workshop, we put together a few key opportunity areas to address with our design:
							</br>
						</br>
							<BLOCKQUOTE>
								Fosters need to feel heard and valued and have open communication with the organization’s teams.
									</br>Fosters need consistent and reliable access to animal information such as behavior notes or medication information to feel best prepared when fostering an animal.
										</br>Fosters need a place to socialize with other fosters to establish a sense of community and feel supported.
										</BLOCKQUOTE>
							<strong>Ideation</strong>
							<p>As a part of our ideation exercise, each team member drew concept sketches based on our insights. We then prioritized designs and established design requirements with the major decision being to focus solely on building the foster experience and exclude the organization’s experience.</p>
							<strong>Concept Testing</strong>
							<p>Based on our ideation exercises we created a low fidelity prototype and built out the major sections we were hoping to receive feedback on during initial concept testing. From our research, we knew it was important to include an organization check-in flow, community section, and an area where fosters can reach out to organizations specifically for help with medical, behavior, or other foster animal needs.
							</br>We wanted to ensure that our design was meeting the needs of the foster users and decided to test early. For the concept test, I created a study plan that included the goals, research questions, and task flows the participants would be completing. I conducted two one-hour long sessions where participants walked through six tasks sharing their impressions and expectations along the way.</p>
							<strong>Usability Testing</strong>
							<p>Taking feedback from our initial concept testing we revisited some navigation issues, search functionality, and made some features clearer. We also addressed what would be incorporated in the community section based on the fosters expressed expectations and needs.
							I conducted three one-hour sessions where participants walked through six core tasks in the app using a think-aloud protocol to share their thoughts on the final design.
							</p>
							<strong>Future Direction</strong>
							<p>From the start, the primary hurdle facing our project was time. Initially, we planned to include the design for the organization’s side as well but found that we needed to scope our project down. We made the decision to focus solely on the foster experience within our design instead. This decision was a difficult one because we know the vital role organizations play in the foster experience as they manage all facets of the animal’s journey and provide resources for the fosters as well. Therefore, with more time we would conduct further research on the organization processes and design an experience that would best fit their needs. After this step, we would integrate both experiences to create a cohesive design.</p>
