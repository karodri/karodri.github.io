							<h1>Shopping Experiences</h1>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<strong>The Challenge</strong> 
								<p>The client, an online e-commerce company, wanted to investigate two experiences they offer their customers. The first experience included shopping for books via voice using an AI assistant and the second experience involved a shopping list app where customers were presented with recommendations to add to their list.</p>							<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<strong>Planning</strong> 
							<p>The client provided all prototypes for the features they wanted to be tested and had exact research questions they wanted the study to answer.</p>
							<p>Working from a list of research questions and prototypes, I created a first draft of the study plan. I started by familiarizing myself with the voice user flows from the AI assistant and generated potential questions that would facilitate participant’s expectations when shopping for books via voice. Then I spent time with the shopping list app, for the second part of the study, and drafted four scenarios that would allow participants to interact with the key features.</p>
							<p>After reviewing the study plan with the client, it became evident that there were too many prototypes for the participants to evaluate during the shopping list portion of the study. As a result, we decided to scope down the project and concentrate on a first-time experience for all participants going from eight prototypes to four.</p>
							<strong>Moderation</strong>
							<p>In the span of three days, I ran ten ninety-minute long sessions. We started the session off by discussing the participants’ past experiences using their AI assistant to shop to gain a general understanding of their current mental model of shopping via voice.</p>
							<p>After these initial introductory questions, we transitioned into the book shopping scenarios where participants were asked about their expectations before hearing each flow. Once presented to them, participants were asked about their initial impressions on the content shared. From here, we’d probe on their attitudes and ask questions on what their next steps would be if they were interested in purchasing the book. We also asked participants to rank their preferred voice user interaction variation based on the manner in which they shop for books.</p>
							<p>Once participants completed the first portion of the study, we transitioned into the second part of the study where we focused on creating shopping lists. Again, we started this phase with introductory questions to understand how participants create shopping lists, which methods they employ, and why. We quickly moved on to the prototypes, which led participants to create a shopping list from scratch using the recommendations. From here, we’d observe how they would interact with the UI elements and ask questions regarding the features along the way.</p>
							<p>We also looked at whether or not participants noticed or realized what the suggestions within the shopping list were, which were located beneath the food categories making it unclear that they were recommendations to be added to their list. If by the end of the scenario, participants hadn’t recognized the suggestions on their own, we’d introduce the feature directly and ask further questions.</p>
