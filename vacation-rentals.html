							<strong>The Challenge</strong>
							<p>The client, an online travel agency, wanted to better understand the circumstances that lead to customer relocation with new vacation rental properties. Our challenge was to design and execute a qualitative study that would bridge this understanding with data to minimize these inconvenient situations for customers and maximize retention of new properties to the marketplace.</p>
							<!--<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
							<strong>Planning</strong>
							<p>The client had a specific hotelier profile in mind and a few research questions they wanted to answer. We planned to interview hotelier partners with recent relocations so that we could understand in depth the processes taking place during these incidents. Listening to the partners would enable us to surmise where possible pain points lie during relocation for both partners and customers.</p>
							<p>Using the list of research questions and customer relocation data provided by the client, I created a first draft of the study plan and interview script. I began by letting the data on relocations digest in order to have context when listening to participants’ experiences. I drafted a few open-ended questions that would provide opportunities for further probing.</p>
							<p>Upon reviewing the study plan and interview script with the client, additional questions were added to delve into the hotelier’s initial onboarding experience. This additional information would help identify high priority improvements for initial onboarding from the partners perspective. Providing a seamless onboarding experience would aid in retention of new properties.</p>
							<strong>Moderation</strong>
							<p>In four days I ran eight one-hour sessions where I interviewed partners on their relocation experiences. I began the session listening to partners recount their onboarding process with the travel agency compared to other travel agencies they list properties on. We then moved into talking about specific relocation incidents that occurred and how they managed them. During this phase, we dove into their personal procedures and the role that the travel agency plays in their process. After discussing the involvement of the online travel agency, participants shared suggestions on what the business can do to better support the relocation process.</p>

								<strong>Key Insights</strong>
							<OL>
							<LI>Communication with the online travel agency is lacking during and after the relocation process. This causes partners to feel unsupported as they do not receive follow up on the resolution from the online travel agency.
							<LI>There is no support from the online travel agency when trying to find alternative accommodations for guests. Partners expected to have an option to collaborate with the online travel agency during these stressful incidents.
							<LI>Partners reported a lack of empathy when working with the online travel agency representatives during relocation incidents.
